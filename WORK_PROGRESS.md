# Work Progress Log

    October 25, 2021
    I am still learning how the libraries needed to make Web Scraping
    possible work and more information about how networking works.

    If I want to convert ASCII-related text, then I can use libcurl -> libtidy ->
    libxml to more easily convert the ASCII-related text into something human inter-
    pretable. However, I am also thinking of applications related to other languages
    that may use Unicode Format, so I also installed the ICU library that 
    transfers unicode format data.

    Tomorrow, let's continue reading the documentation for libcurl.
    Continue reading the examples, and then formulate a plan for making 
    a barebones functional piece of documentation.
