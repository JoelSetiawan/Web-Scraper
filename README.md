# Keylogger
    Why?

    I want to track my vocabulary by first tracking what 
strings I am typing onto my computer so that I can
see my vocabulary usage statistics. 

    Design

        My Prediction for an Algorithm for a Keylogger
        1. Log file to put output.
        2. A way to detect text input.
        3. A way to record text input.
        4. A way to write text input onto log.
        5. A way to sleep the program to reduce usage to 0%.
        6. Creating an executable so that I run the program constantly.

        The recommendation for an algorithm for a keylogger
        1. Create a log file to store output
        2. Intercept keys pressed with getAsyncKeyState() function
        3. Store intercepted values in log
        4. Hide the Running Window Dialogue to make it undetectable
        5. Use while looping to run in all conditions
        6. Add Sleep function to reduce CPU usage to 0%
