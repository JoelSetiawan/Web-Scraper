# Web Scraper

    Why?

    I want to create a program that can quickly extract data and collect it into a database.

    Practical applications: Stock Ticker Information, Updates For Websites I love, and Regex applications, creating a persona for a person based on their internet patterns.

    Startup

    A web scraper is a program that is able to transfer data, parse it, and collect it.
    To turn this data into something that I can use, I need to convert the data into a format that is
    usable. C++ has libraries that are able to interpret XML well. XML is an eXtensive markup language that
    is much more friendly to C++ than HTML. To convert the data into XML, I am going to collect the data through
    an HTML library, then I can work on converting the XML into some meaningful information (interpreting data).
